## Background

This project required that I create an entire application from scratch. It involved using all of my knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, accessibility, service workers, and React to create a functional Google Maps application.

## Installation

To access the project, click [here](https://neocyte.github.io/Neighborhood-Maps/).

## How-To-Use

* There is a Google Map on the right side that shows 5 of my favorite food locations within Chinatown, New York City.

  * You can click on the location list or each location's marker to reveal more information about that particular location.

  * You can type inside the search bar to filter through the 5 locations.

## Important
* By default, the create-react-app includes a service worker in the production build. To run a production build: `npm build`.

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

* This project uses the [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/details) to fetch information about each location.
